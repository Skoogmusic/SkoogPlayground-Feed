Learn about notes, octaves, input devices, animation, counters, and find out how to use event handlers. Change thresholds to adjust how your code responds to presses and squeezes on your Skoog.  Experiment with echoes, physics, and musical harmony using an interactive musical buddy called \u2018Ping\u2019.\n\nAre you ready to get hands-on with Swift and take your new musical instrument for a spin?",
